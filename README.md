# Cognifyz_Password-Strength-Checker
This project is a Python program that evaluates the strength of a password based on specific security criteria. It analyzes the password’s length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and overall complexity to determine whether it’s Weak, Moderate, or Strong.
